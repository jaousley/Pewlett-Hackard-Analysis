# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
Pewlett-Hackard wants to be prepared to fill the large number of positions that will be open as baby boomers begin to enter retirement. The company needs to know who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled. The purpose of the analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 


## Results

### Analysis

- More than half of the staff retiring soon hold senior positions. Pewlett-Hackard will need to train and promote other employees to fill these positions or hire from the outside. 

- Over 90,000 employees may be retiring in the next few years. 

- The company doesn't have very many baby boomers in management positions. Only two managers will be retiring in the next few years. 

- Neither of the managers are eligible for the mentorship program 

## Summary 

90,398 positions will need to be filed as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. Most of the positions are senior level positions, specifically senior engineers and senior staff. There are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. Not every eligible employee will want to participate and even if they all did it would not be enough to fill the gap for the potential 90,398 vacant positions. 

### Additional Tables

To provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami" a table could be created that ordered the mentorship_eligibiltiy table by department. Also a table showing how many employees are eligible for promotion in the proper departments from retiring_titles. This will help the company decide how many positions need to be filled from the outside instead.
